# Laravel Docbot

> **Modern API documentation and custom command listing for Laravel 11/12**

[!NOTE]

> Laravel Docbot is a developer-focused package for generating API docs and listing custom Artisan commands, with configuration and code quality built-in.

---

## ðŸš€ Introduction

Laravel Docbot automates API documentation and custom command discovery for Laravel projects. It generates Markdown and Postman collections for your routes, and lists all custom Artisan commandsâ€”helping teams keep docs up-to-date and developer onboarding frictionless.

---

## Main Use Cases

- **API Documentation:** Instantly generate Markdown and Postman collections for all API routes, segmented by prefix.
- **Custom Command Listing:** List all custom Artisan commands, excluding built-in Laravel/Artisan commands.
- **Configurable Output:** Control output directories, route segments, and command exclusions via config.

---

## Quick Installation

```bash
composer require equidnamx/laravel-docbot
```

> Requires Laravel 11 or 12 and PHP >=8.0

---

## Minimal Usage Example

### Generate API Documentation

```bash
php artisan docbot:routes
```

### List Custom Commands

```bash
php artisan docbot:commands
```

### Publish and Edit Configuration

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Equidna\LaravelDocbot\LaravelDocbotServiceProvider" --tag=config
```

Edit `config/docbot.php` to customize segments, output directories, and command exclusions:

```php
'segments' => [
    ['key' => 'api', 'prefix' => 'api/', 'token' => 'API_TOKEN'],
    // ...
],
'exclude_namespaces' => [ ... ],
'exclude_commands' => [ ... ],
```

## Technical Overview

- **Command-based workflow:** All features are implemented as Artisan commands.
- **API docs:** Reads route definitions via `Artisan::call('route:list', ['--json' => true])`, segments by prefix, outputs to `doc/routes/<segment>/`.
- **Custom commands:** Filters built-in commands using config, outputs to `doc/commands/project_commands.md`.
- **Config-driven:** All exclusions and segments are set in `config/docbot.php`.
- **Code quality:** PSR-12 enforced, static analysis with PHPStan, tests with PHPUnit.

[!TIP]

> Use `phpcbf` and `vendor/bin/phpstan analyse src/ --level=max` to maintain code quality before submitting PRs.

---

## Development Instructions

- **Run tests:**
  ```bash
  vendor/bin/phpunit
  ```
- **Static analysis:**
  ```bash
  vendor/bin/phpstan analyse src/ --level=max
  ```
- **Code style:**
  ```bash
  phpcbf src/
  ```
